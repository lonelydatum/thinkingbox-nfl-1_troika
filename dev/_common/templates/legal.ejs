		The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Ratings reflect performance as of September 30, 2017 (for class F shares only) and are subject to change monthly. The ratings are calculated from a fund’s 3, 5, and 10-year returns measured against 91-day Treasury bill and peer group returns. For each time period, the top 10% of funds in a category get five stars. The Overall Rating is a weighted combination of the 3, 5, and 10-year ratings. For greater detail, see www.morningstar.ca. The star ratings for: Renaissance U.S. Equity Income Fund and number of U.S. Equity funds for each period are as follows: one year, 2 stars, 1306 funds; three years, 5 stars, 872 funds; Renaissance Floating Rate Income Fund and number of Floating Rate Loan funds for each period are as follows: one year, 2 stars, 110 funds; three years, 5 stars, 72 funds; Renaissance Corporate Bond Fund and number of Canadian Fixed Income funds for each period are as follows: one year, 5 stars, 586 funds; three years, 5 stars, 456 funds; five years, 5 stars, 371 funds; Renaissance Optimal Income Portfolio and number of Canadian Fixed Income Balanced funds for each period are as follows: one year, 4 stars, 541 funds; three years, 5 stars, 421 funds; five years, 5 stars, 310 funds. ©2017 Morningstar Research Inc.
